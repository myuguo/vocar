# chip_bldc_driver
Chip Robotics BLDC ROS Driver  

To get started make sure you have ros serial installed  
e.g. for melodic  
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-serial  

create a directory to install the driver and cd into the director  
mkdir src     
cd src  
catkin_init_workspace  
git clone https://github.com/chiprobotics/chip_bldc_driver.git  
cd ..  
catkin_make  
source ./devel/setup.bash  
roslaunch chip_bldc_driver example.launch  

make sure you have the right permission set on /dev/ttyUSB0 (for a quick hack just use sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0)  
instruction on using udev will be coming soon.   

For a quick test open a new terminal   
cd into the folder and run source ./devel/setup.bash   
then run rostopic pub -r 10 /bldc_driver_node/Command chip_bldc_driver/Command "motor_command: 100" to see the motor spin.   
It is recommended you first setup the motor with the windows or linux software before running ROS to control the motor.
